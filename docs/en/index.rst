e-cidadania documentation
=========================

**e-cidadania** is an open-source e-democracy web tool intended for citizen participation.

e-cidadania was designed with complex participative processes in mind, lile a participative budget
where people can decide what to do with a part of the annual bugets of a region or city, where
making a simple meeting and disordered proposals doesn't meet the expectations.

This software is based on the `django <http://www.djangoproject.com>`_ framework
and some external libraries.

.. warning:: e-cidadania is in heavy development, because of that some parts
             of it may suffer changes, especially the data models and documentation
             until some releases.
